    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Technology is changing at a breakneck speed, and it is getting harder and harder for people to keep up with it
      let alone understand how to use it.
      We live in an increasingly “smart” world. Our refrigerators can tell us when we need to shop, and our televisions
      can tell us when someone is at the door, so unless you’re my six your old nephew
      who could work an iPhone better then I could when he was three understanding and making your technology work is
      becoming a challenge.</p> <!-- change this -->


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My audience or demogrphic is anyone who is not tech savvy as they would like to be or that need help with
      technology.</p> <!-- change this -->

    <p>
      Questions- Why will people come to my site-
      There are many different reasons why people might want to come to my site.
      The biggest reason is they will be coming because they are in need of web site design services or other graphic
      design services.
      The other reason is that I offer many different tech services many that are not filled by other companies.
      Some of those services involve helping people with in home issues like setting up printers, helping with internet
      solutions.
      But we also offer help with figuring out with purchase help. Not to sell them a product but to help figure out
      what they would like and then
      we would help them get it set up. We will set up computes, phones, printers, televisions, tablets, and any other
      tech they need help with.
      We also offer tutoring on the use of computer, cell phones or other tech

      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <P>My story copy-
        It has taken me a very long time to figure out what I wanted to do with my life.
        The only thing I did know is that I wanted to work for myself, I just never knew what that would be.
        My journey to this business started while I was working for a satellite company doing installs and repairs.
        During the course of my job people would ask me to help them with different types of tech problems that had
        nothing to do with
        my reason for being there. They tell you that all the best business solves a problem that needs to be solved and
        that is what this
        business does. There are so many people who struggle with technology and quickly it changes. The hardest part
        for them is that they
        dont know where to go and if they can find someone to help they often won’t take such small jobs. We go into
        people homes
        and we take care of those jobs. We help hook up their printers, setup televisions, help with computer issues,
        cell phones
        or tablets. We will also help with setting up email accounts or installing programs. But it doesn’t stop there.
        We also offer a variety of tutoring services for those who want to learn.
        The other side of the business came about from an entirely different journey.
        I have always regretted not finishing my bachelor's degree and I wanted to find something that gave me
        creativity and stability.
        I have always enjoyed designing logos, and other things and it was an easy transition to creating websites.
        It gives the best of both worlds and allows to continue doing what I love to which is to help people pursue
        their dreams.
