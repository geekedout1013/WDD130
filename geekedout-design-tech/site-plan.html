    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Technology is changing at a breakneck speed, and it is getting harder and harder for people to keep up with it
      let alone understand how to use it.
      We live in an increasingly “smart” world. Our refrigerators can tell us when we need to shop, and our televisions
      can tell us when someone is at the door, so unless you’re my six your old nephew
      who could work an iPhone better then I could when he was three understanding and making your technology work is
      becoming a challenge.</p> <!-- change this -->


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My audience or demogrphic is anyone who is not tech savvy as they would like to be or that need help with
      technology.</p> <!-- change this -->
