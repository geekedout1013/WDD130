                    It has taken me a very long time to figure out what it is I wanted to do with my
                    life.

                <p class="copy-par-1a-ms">
                    The only thing I did know was that I wanted to work for myself, I just never knew what that
                    would be.</p>

                <p class="copy-par-2-ms">
                    My journey to this business started while I was working for a satellite company doing
                    installs and repairs.
                    During the course of my job people would ask me to help them with different types of tech
                    problems that had nothing to do with my
                    reason for being there.</p>
                <h3 class="heading-copy-3-ms">
                    It is said that the best business solves a problem that needs to be solved and that
                    is what this business does!</h3>



                <!-- <div class="add-copy-ms">
                    <h1>Tech help for everyone</h1> -->
                <!-- 
                    <p class="copy-par-4-ms">So many people struggle with technology and how quickly it changes.</p>
                    <ul class="ms-list">
                        <li class="items-ms">The hardest part for them is that they dont
                            know where to go and if they can find
                            someone to help.
                            We go into people homes and we take care of those jobs. We help hook up their
                            printers,
                            setup televisions, help with computer issues,
                            cell phones or tablets.</li>
                        <li class="items-ms">We will also help with setting up email accounts or installing
                            programs. But it doesn&39t stop there.</li>
                        <li class="items-ms">We also offer a variety of tutoring services for those who want to
                            learn.</li> -->

                <p class="copy-par-3">The otherside
                    of the business came about from an entirely
                    different journey. I
                    wanted to find something that gave me creativity
                    and stability. I have always enjoyed designing logos, and other things and it was an
                    easy transition to creating websites.
                    It gives the best of both worlds and allows to continue doing what I love to which
                    is to
                    help people pursue their dreams.</p>
