            My story copy- It has taken me a very long time to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. 
            The only thing I did know is that I wanted to work for myself, I just never knew what that would be. 
            My journey to this business started while I was working for a satellite company doing installs and repairs. 
            During the course of my job people would ask me to help them with different types of tech problems that had nothing to do with my
             reason for being there. 
            They tell you that all the best business solves a problem that needs to be solved and that is what this business does.

                There are so many people who struggle with technology and quickly it changes. 
                The hardest part for them is that they dont know where to go and if they can find someone to help they often won’t take such small jobs. 
                We go into people homes and we take care of those jobs. We help hook up their printers, setup televisions, help with computer issues, 
                cell phones or tablets. We will also help with setting up email accounts or installing programs. But it doesn’t stop there. 
                We also offer a variety of tutoring services for those who want to learn. The other side of the business came about from an entirely 
                different journey. I have always regretted not finishing my bachelor's degree and I wanted to find something that gave me creativity 
                and stability. I have always enjoyed designing logos, and other things and it was an easy transition to creating websites. 
                It gives the best of both worlds and allows to continue doing what I love to which is to help people pursue their dreams.
            <!-- <p class="copy-tech-par-2">We will set up computes, phones, printers, televisions, tablets, and any other tech they need help with.
